# KRX Replays

Welcome to the **KRX Replays** repository! This repository contains `.tas` files for **KRX Client** users to load replays and play moves on various Teeworlds maps.

## Overview

- The `.tas` files are organized into folders based on Teeworlds maps.
- These files are designed to work exclusively with **KRX Ultimate** (the paid version of the KRX Client).
- Use these `.tas` files to load pre-configured replays and execute precise moves in the game.

## Prerequisites

- **KRX Client**: Ensure you have the **KRX Ultimate** version installed. The free version does not support `.tas` files.
- A valid `.tas` file for the desired map.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/krx-replays.git
```

2. Navigate to the folder of the map you want to play.

```bash
cd krx-replays/<map-folder>
```

3. Open the KRX Client and load the `.tas` file using the built-in replay loader.

### Note:

If the `.tas` file is not located in any map folder, it should still be possible to load it manually through the KRX Client.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have `.tas` files for maps that are not yet included in this repository:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add the `.tas` file to the appropriate map folder or create a new folder for the map.
3. Submit a pull request.
